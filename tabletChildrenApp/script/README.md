# Safari

##Description

Kids aged 2-4 years are an interesting audience to design for: while they don't yet have assumptions and expectations for interfaces, but they have other limitations. For example, they associate one function with one object, and see everything in two dimensions on the screen without having the illusion of depth. (source: Debra Levin Gelman - Design for Kids)

Complicated or ambiguous interfaces don't accommodate these children's skills and make them frustrated. The same goes for too exciting ones. From these conclusions the goal was to create an application that is part animation, part interaction, calm but not boring, where tiny users have some input but cannot control everything, and after a while they can get bored and put it down on their own. Inspiration also comes from the concept of slow TV.

##First steps
Right now we are trying out and collecting some animated figures with some kind of reaction on touch. When they come together, it would be like a safari, where characters come, stay and leave, and children can interact with them while they are there, but then have to accept when a new figure comes along.
