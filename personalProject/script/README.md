# Memory filter



## Description

Humans are emotional and subjective creatures, so what we have seen somewhere and what we remember later is not the same. In this project I want to make the difference visible and comparable by modifying an image, which is a more objective record than the one in our brain.
Possible changes: adding effects, objects or information not visible on the image, possibly some noise.

The user can drag and drop their own image on the canvas, and then add the changes (or the changes happen).


## First steps

First I imagined a timeline slider where the user can see how does the image look as time passes (1 day, 1 month, etc). In the first sketch I aimed to connect the value of the slider to some visual effect, which is now the alpha value of the dots that appear. It feels like raining.
Conceptually though I am not yet convinced of the sliderâ€™s necessity, or if it should be used this way.

## Open questions

How much control does the user have? How many options? Examples: sad filter. Or is every change set (random filter, etc)?

Noise options: add glitch, dots, lose some colours, etc.

Should it include text at all? Can the user enter just date/time, or free text to add (e.g. piece of conversation at the same time)?

Can it sometimes destroy the image (forget), cancel parts?

Should the change just happen instantly or gradually get stronger?
